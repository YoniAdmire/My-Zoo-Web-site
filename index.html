            <p> Bears are large animals with short tails that mainly live in the Americas,
                Asia, and Europe. They are the largest of the carnivores, or flesh-eating land
                mammals. However, besides the meat-eating polar bears and the bamboo-eating panda
                bears, most bears are omnivorous (eating both plant and animal matter). Although
                bears have a reputation for being fierce and aggressive, they are more often peaceful
                and solitary creatures. They usually gain weight in the autumn and sleep fitfully 
                through much of the winter, but they do not truly hibernate. Despite their bulk, most 
                bears climb with ease and swim strongly.

            <p> Giraffes are the tallest land animals. A giraffe could look into a second-story
                window without even having to stand on its tiptoes! A giraffe's 6-foot (1.8-meter) 
                neck weighs about 600 pounds (272 kilograms). The legs of a giraffe are also 6 feet 
                (1.8 meters) long. The back legs look shorter than the front legs, but they are about 
                the same length. A giraffe's heart is 2 feet (0.6 meters) long and weighs about 25 pounds 
                (11 kilograms), and its lungs can hold 12 gallons (55 liters) of air! Its closest relative 
                is the okapi.

            <p> Living in the grasslands, scrub, and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, 
                the lion is the second largest cat in the world. It is about 1.6-2 m (5-8 ft.) 
                long from head to rump and weighs up to 227 kg (500 lb.). It is dwarfed in size only 
                by the tiger, which is closely related and has a very similar body type.

            <p> Alligators are fascinating creatures that have been around for millions of years! Let's 
                dive into some cool facts about these amazing reptiles.
                Alligators are large reptiles that live in freshwater environments like rivers, lakes, 
                and swamps. They are cold-blooded, which means they rely on the sun to warm up.
